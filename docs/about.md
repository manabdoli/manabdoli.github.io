I'm a full-time instructor at CSUF and a statistician with a multidisciplinary
background (EE, IE, and Stat) and interests in statistical analysis, pedagogy, 
and collaborative research across diverse
domains.

I also enjoy creating simple tools to help me with teaching, mentoring, and research. This site is a space where I share my work, ideas, and resources.

If you're interested in data, learning, or interdisciplinary collaboration, Iâ€™d love to connect.
