## `du4tnr` Package:
This package was originally developed to assist student scholars in CSUF's 
[NAARE Program](https://naare.fullerton.edu/) in producing sound statistical
analysis while working with the [NACC data](https://naccdata.org/).

With the support of CSUF through a 
[JrSr Research Grant](https://www.fullerton.edu/research/intramural-funding/index.html),
and due to limitations on sharing the original data, I stripped the data and 
packaged the functionality into the `du4tnr` package. [more](https://manabdoli.github.io/du4tnr/).
